# Project Summary
In this project, we create a Java program that simulates a queuing system. Time-driven simulation is used, i.e. the program must "go in small time steps" and simulate what happens within each time period. 

The system we are going to model is a small (but busy) airport with only one runway and two queues with planes:
- landing queue
- take-off queue

Skills that was demonstrated in this project:
- implementation and use of circular array queue
- problem solving
- algorithm development
- code structuring
- OOP with Java (v15)

### How to compile (from shell)
move to *algorithms-and-data-structures/01_Airport/src*, and then execute the following command:
```
$ javac Airport.java
```

### How to run 
Use the following command:
```
$ java Airport.java
```
