# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains different modules (other modules will be added), where each module represents a project that were given as a mandatory assignment in a course that I took name Algorithms and Data Structures. 

Each module starts with a number that represents project number. There are six different projects that include training in:
01. Data Structures
02. Analysis of algorithms
03. Introduction to Collections -- Stacks
04. Linked Structures -- Stacks
05. Queues
06. Lists
08. Recursion
09. Sorting and Searching
10. Trees
11. Binary Search Trees
12. Heaps and Priority Queues
13. Sets and Maps

### README
Every project has its own README.md file.

There are 6 main projects inside this repository. I have developed my code mainly using IntelliJ, that's why you see a "*.idea*" folder above which you can ignore, or use it to import the repository directly to your IntelliJ IDEA if you have it installed.

There is a Project summary section in the beginning of each README.md file, which gives a short description of the project. Please check out the pdf file, inside the "*extra-materials*" folder of each project, to see more information about the problems that each project solve, and some additional details like example output.
