# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains different modules (other modules will be added), where each module represents a project that were given as a mandatory assignment in a one of my courses, called *Algorithms and Data Structures*.

Each module starts with a number that represents project number. There are 5 different projects that include training in **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Analysis of algorithms**:

01. Introduction to Collections -- Stacks
02. Linked Structures -- Stacks
03. Queues
04. Lists
05. Recursion
06. Sorting and Searching
07. Trees

### README
Every project has its own README.md file.

There are 5 main projects inside this repository. There is a Project summary section in the beginning of each README.md file, which gives a short description of the project. Please check out the pdf file, inside the "*extra-materials*" folder of each project, to see more information about the problems that each project solve, and some additional details like example outputs.
